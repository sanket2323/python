🧱 1. Variables and Data Types

    Create a variable name and assign your name to it. Print it with a greeting.

    Store your height (float) and age (int) in variables. Print their types.

    Create variables price = 199.99 and quantity = 5. Calculate and print total cost.

    Take a string number "25" and convert it to int. Add 10 and print result.

    Swap values of two variables without using a third variable, and print the result.

🔢 2. Mathematical Expressions

    Calculate the square of a number and print the result.

    Take input for radius and compute the area of a circle.

    Create a BMI calculator (weight / height²). Format result to 2 decimals.

    Take 2 numbers and calculate their GCD (greatest common divisor).

    Create a program to compute compound interest using:
    A = P * (1 + r/n)^(n*t)

🔁 3. Loops

    Print numbers from 1 to 10 using a for loop.

    Print the first 10 multiples of 3 using a while loop.

    Print a triangle pattern using *, like:

    *
    **
    ***

    Take a list of numbers and use a loop to find their average.

    Print the first 10 prime numbers using a loop.

🧮 4. Functions

    Write a function to return the square of a number.

    Create a function that takes a string and returns its length.

    Write a function that checks if a number is even or odd.

    Create a function that takes a list and returns the second-largest number.

    Write a recursive function to calculate the factorial of a number.

📋 5. Lists and Tuples

    Create a list of 5 cities and print the third one.

    Add a new city to the list, then remove one by name.

    Sort a list of integers in descending order without using sort().

    Create a tuple of 5 numbers. Use slicing to print the middle three.

    Write a program to find common elements in two lists (intersection logic).

6.Use enumerate() to print index and item from a list of fruits.

    Loop through a list of numbers and print only even-indexed values.

    Modify enumerate() to start counting from 100.

    Combine enumerate() with conditionals: Print index of items > 50.

    Create your own version of enumerate() using a for loop.

7. Use map() to convert a list of strings to uppercase.

    Square all elements in a list using map().

    Convert a list of strings to integers using map().

    Use map() with a custom function that adds 10 to each item.

    Use map() with lambda to remove spaces from a list of strings.

8. Create a lambda that returns the cube of a number.

    Use lambda inside map() to add 5 to each number.

    Use lambda inside filter() to remove empty strings.

    Sort a list of tuples by the second item using lambda.

    Combine map() and lambda() to apply logic on two lists.
